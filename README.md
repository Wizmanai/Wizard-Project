This project uses an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to generate text. The text this generates, is the tweet that shall be posted. It is automated to respond to specific usernames but will respond until it gets over saturated with comments.

Precautions
Any generated text will be scanned!

If you see this project and the AI has tweeted something offensive and / or something that you think should not be tweeted, please do not contact me that is the point
